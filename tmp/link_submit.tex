Paper submission
All submissions must use the ACM SIGPLAN Conference Format “acmart”. Please be sure to use the latest LaTeX templates and class files. the sigplan sub-format, and 10 point font. Consult the sample-sigplan.tex template and use the document-class \\documentclass[sigplan,anonymous,review]{acmart}.

To increase fairness in reviewing, a double-blind review process has become standard across SIGPLAN conferences. GPCE will follow a very lightweight model, where author identities are revealed to reviewers after submitting their initial reviews. Hence, the purpose is not to conceal author identities at all cost, but merely to provide reviewers with an unbiased first look at a submission. Author names and institutions should be omitted from submitted papers, and references to the authors’ own related work should be in the third person. No other changes are necessary, and authors will not be penalized if reviewers are able to infer their identities in implicit ways.

Papers must be submitted using HotCRP: https://gpce18.hotcrp.com/
